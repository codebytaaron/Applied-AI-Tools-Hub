# ruby-sop-writer

Ruby CLI template that turns steps into an SOP with checklists.

This repo is intentionally written in **Ruby** (not Python/JS) so GitHub shows a different language mix.

```bash
ruby main.rb
```

## Input format
Put your notes in `input.txt` (or pipe stdin). Output is printed to stdout.
