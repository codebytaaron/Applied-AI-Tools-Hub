# haskell-kpi-dictionary

Haskell CLI template that outputs KPI definitions and formulas.

This repo is intentionally written in **Haskell** (not Python/JS) so GitHub shows a different language mix.

## Run
```bash
ghc Main.hs -o app
./app
```

## Input format
Put your notes in `input.txt` (or pipe stdin). Output is printed to stdout.
