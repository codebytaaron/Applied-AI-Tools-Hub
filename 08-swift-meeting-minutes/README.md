# swift-meeting-minutes

Swift CLI template that formats meeting notes into minutes.

This repo is intentionally written in **Swift** (not Python/JS) so GitHub shows a different language mix.

## Run
```bash
swift main.swift
```

## Input format
Put your notes in `input.txt` (or pipe stdin). Output is printed to stdout.
