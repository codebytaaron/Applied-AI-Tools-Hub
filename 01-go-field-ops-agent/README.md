# go-field-ops-agent

Go CLI template that formats job notes into a work order.

This repo is intentionally written in **Go** (not Python/JS) so GitHub shows a different language mix.

## Run
```bash
go run .
```

## Input format
Put your notes in `input.txt` (or pipe stdin). Output is printed to stdout.
