# rust-policy-drafter

Rust CLI template that drafts a structured policy outline from notes.

This repo is intentionally written in **Rust** (not Python/JS) so GitHub shows a different language mix.

## Run
```bash
cargo run
```

## Input format
Put your notes in `input.txt` (or pipe stdin). Output is printed to stdout.
