# csharp-estimator-agent

C# CLI template that builds an itemized estimate from a scope.

This repo is intentionally written in **CSharp** (not Python/JS) so GitHub shows a different language mix.

## Run
```bash
dotnet new console --force
# replace Program.cs, then:
dotnet run
```

## Input format
Put your notes in `input.txt` (or pipe stdin). Output is printed to stdout.
