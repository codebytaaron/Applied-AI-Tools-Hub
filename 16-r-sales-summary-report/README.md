# r-sales-summary-report

R script template that turns metrics into an exec summary report.

This repo is intentionally written in **R** (not Python/JS) so GitHub shows a different language mix.

## Run
```bash
Rscript main.R
```

## Input format
Put your notes in `input.txt` (or pipe stdin). Output is printed to stdout.
