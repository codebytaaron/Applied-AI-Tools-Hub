# perl-invoice-generator

Perl CLI template that creates a basic invoice markdown.

This repo is intentionally written in **Perl** (not Python/JS) so GitHub shows a different language mix.

## Run
```bash
perl main.pl
```

## Input format
Put your notes in `input.txt` (or pipe stdin). Output is printed to stdout.
